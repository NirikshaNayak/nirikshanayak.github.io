# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Niriksha.

Iâ€™m a Technical Writer & AI Generalist-in-self-training, blending writing, UX, and automation with the power of tools like ChatGPT, DALLÂ·E, Canva, Notion AI, and GitHub.

This portfolio showcases hands-on projects I've completed as part of an AI content and UX training sprint â€” each one combining prompt engineering, visual design, and real-world writing skills.

Youâ€™ll also find a few samples from company projects I've worked on, shared carefully while respecting confidentiality agreements.
